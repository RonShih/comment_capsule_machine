My first project in college, its an application to let people make friends or leave a comment without face to face.
Everyone can leave a comment and your name as an envelope to this machine, people who click the button will randomly get an envelope.

Front-end: simple animation by javascript.
Back-end: all comments (data) will be inserted into database and retrieve randomly from it.
